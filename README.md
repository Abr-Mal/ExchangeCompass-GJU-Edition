# üá©üá™ ExchangeCompass: GJU Edition (Multilingual Student Advisor) üß≠

## üöÄ 1. Overview and Problem Statement

**The Challenge:** Students from GJU preparing for their final-year exchange to Germany face a significant information gap. They rely on scattered, non-standardized feedback to decide on a host university, particularly regarding non-academic factors like **Cost of Living** and **Accommodation**.

**The Solution:** ExchangeCompass is a full-stack, data-driven web application designed to centralize and quantify this scattered student opinion. It provides a transparent, objective platform by analyzing multilingual student feedback (English and Arabic) and converting it into comparable, objective scores.

**Key Deliverable:** The project's success is defined by its ability to merge high-integrity survey data with publicly sourced reviews, proving the viability of using advanced AI for niche, real-world advisory services.

### ‚ú® 2. Core Features

The application provides the following actionable features:

1.  **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA):**
    * Utilizes the **Google Gemini API** to analyze unstructured text and break down student feedback into quantifiable scores (1-5) across four critical aspects: **Academic Rigor, Cost of Living, Social Scene, and Accommodation.**
2.  **Multilingual Pipeline:**
    * Successfully processes and standardizes feedback collected in **English and Arabic** within a single AI-driven ingestion pipeline, demonstrating robust cross-lingual data handling.
3.  **Data Blending & Trust Score:**
    * Unifies two data streams: **Consent-based Survey Responses** (high trust) and **Anonymized Web-Scraped Reviews** (high volume). Users can filter results based on the data source.
4.  **Interactive Comparison Dashboard:**
    * Allows users to select two universities for a side-by-side comparison of all ABSA scores, core cost metrics, and underlying qualitative review summaries.
